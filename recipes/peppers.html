        <p>Stuffed peppers with ground beef and rice are topped with seasoned tomato sauce.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>
            <li>16 oz tomato sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until evenly browned and cumbly, 7-9 mins.</li>
            <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.</li>
            <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
            <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, and 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcetershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 mins, until peppers are tender, about 1 h.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
